# Weather-Dashboard
## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice my new server-side API skills and to build an application from the ground up. This weather dashboard demonstrates everything we learned during week six of the bootcamp.



## Installation

The webpage should load with no errors, and you will be met with a search panel. No download or installation needed.

## Usage

Search for any city in the search box and press the search button to launch. You will get the current weather conditions of the chosen city, as well as a forecast for the next 5 days.  The searches will be saved to local storage underneath the search box and you can click on them to display again.
